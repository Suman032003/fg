Explanation:
Polynomial Models:
In both 3.1 and 3.3, we use poly() to fit polynomial terms for TV. In 3.1, a degree 2 polynomial is used, and in 3.3, a degree 5 polynomial is used.
The models include radio as a covariate in both cases.
AIC and BIC Calculation:
AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) are measures to compare models. Lower values suggest a better model fit.
Model Comparison:
In 3.5, you compare the models based on AIC and BIC values. Typically, the model with the lower AIC and BIC is preferred.
